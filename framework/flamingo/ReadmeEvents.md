# Flamingo Events

Flamingo uses a builtin event router, which routes events for each request.

This means that events are request-scoped, so you can assume that fired events should not
cross request boundaries (and are bound to the same go routine).

## When to use Events

Events can be used to fire "Domain Events" - that are events that have a understandable meaning in the domain.
The publisher should do "fire and forget" and should not care about who publishes events.

Do not use events as Hook and do not expect something need to happen when publishing an event.

## Event interfaces

An Event can be everything, usually a struct with a few fields.

```go
LoginSucessEvent struct {
    UserId string
}
```

Events should not have the current context in them!

## Firing events

An Event is fired using the `EventRouter` 

```go
type (
	IndexController struct {
		responder   *web.Responder
		eventRouter flamingo.EventRouter
	}

	MyEvent struct {
		Data string
	}
)

// Inject dependencies
func (controller *IndexController) Inject(
	eventRouter flamingo.EventRouter,
	responder *web.Responder,
) *IndexController {
	controller.responder = responder
	controller.eventRouter = eventRouter

	return controller
}

// Get the data
func (controller *IndexController) Get(ctx context.Context, r *web.Request) web.Result {
	controller.eventRouter.Dispatch(ctx, &MyEvent{Data: "Hello"})

	return controller.responder.TODO()
}
```

## Subscribing to events

To listen to events you need to create a "Subscriber". 
A Subscriber will get all events and need to decide which events it wants to handle:

```go
type (
	EventSubscriber struct{}
)

// Notify should get called by flamingo event logic
func (subscriber *EventSubscriber) Notify(ctx context.Context, event flamingo.Event) {
	if e, ok := event.(*MyEvent); ok {
		subscriber.OnMyEvent(e) // call event handler and do something
	}
}
```

Flamingo uses Dingo multibindings internally to register an event subscriber. In your module's `Configure`,
you can just call `flamingo.BindEventSubscriber` to register your subscriber.

```go
// Configure DI
func (m *MyModule) Configure(injector *dingo.Injector) {
	flamingo.BindEventSubscriber(injector).To(new(EventSubscriber))
}
```
